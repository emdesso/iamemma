<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...Emma</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3> Currently, I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh. I am a Media and Professional Communications student on the Corporate and Community Relations track with a certificate in Digital Media. I have enjoyed my journalism, advertising, and public relations classes. Although initially an architecture major, I changed my mind when I realized how much I enjoyed writing.</h3>
  </div>



<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3> I am both a writer and a creative thinker, which will benefit me in this course. Although I have no experience coding, I am excited to learn as I feel it will help me. I studied abstract art in high school, which will also be useful. Intending to work in Public Relations, media and technology are crucial components of my future. In this course, I plan to develop my design skills further and use unfamiliar programs. </h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3> In my opinion, good design is accessible, innovative, and aesthetic. It challenges both social and individual bounds. My personal design takes an abstract approach but also heavily relies on aesthetics and trends, being that that is what I study.  <br></br>Some great examples of my design style are reflected in my social media accounts, school reports, and even in things such as cards and gifts I make for my friends. My design style significantly reflects and influences my personality and lifestyle choices. I am eager to hone in on my design interests further in this class and refine them. </h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>Post graduation, I want to move to Austin, TX and work in public relations or do consumer marketing. I spent time this past summer in Austin due to my internship and fell in love with the city. This is the field I am the most passionate about and, thus, would produce the best work in.  <br></br>   Growing up somewhere cold and going to school somewhere even colder has influenced me to want to find a warm city. My classes at Pitt with Dr. Klein have also influenced this decision. She has been a great role model for me with her work in PR for Vogue and other publications. Additionally, both of my parents have creative roles at their jobs which facilitated a creative environment for me to grow up in and led to my similar interests. <br></br>
        My design work completed in this course will elevate my skill set, make me a desirable hire, and allow me to feel confident in my capabilities. PR is an ever-changing field, and I need to have a solid digital design foundation.
